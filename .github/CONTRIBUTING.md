## Commits

 - Direct commits on main branch `master` can only be made by maintainers ([see list of maintaines above](#Maintainers)).

 - A pull-request must be created to ask merge from the created branch to the branch `master`
 - Only reviewed pull-request can be merged into `master` branch
 - When a reviewed pull-request is closed, the concerned branch must be deleted
 - It is preferable not to do force-push on `master` branch to keep a prettier commits history tree, but maintainers can do that to rename commits messages if not understandable.
 - When a pull-request is done, you should warn maintainers by assigning the pull-request to one maintainer.
 - If after two weeks, there is no response you can ping a maintainer on YesWiki developement channel : https://forum.yeswiki.net/c/developpement/general/21
 - For contributors with rights to write on the current repository, if no answer is done by a maintainer after three weeks (no contact), you can merge the changes. That's why no security checks are done on commits and push. **This rule is applicable also to change the current rule.**
